# Egnyte Nuke & Update

Scripts used to delete egnyte, all leftover files and reboot if possible

## Versions 
I doubt this one will change much. 

## How to Use 
1. Download files in this folder 
2. `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Unrestricted` to allow running powershell scripts
3. Within powershell , navigate to the folder with the scripts
4. run the "Nuke" script
5. reboot when prompted to
6. run the "Update" script to install the latest version of egnyte - (3.26) as of writing
7. map drives if needed
