üìÇ installingSoftware
This folder houses scripts designed to automate the installation of software located in your C:\Archive directory. It supports both .exe and .msi installers with various levels of automation.

Versions & Functionality
installAllArchiveSoftware.bat (Stable):
A reliable version that sequentially runs each .exe and .msi file found in C:\Archive interactively.

Versions labeled ‚Äúv2‚Äù (Testing):
These versions are under testing and offer more control, splitting installations into silent and interactive modes where necessary. They search for files within C:\Archive.

installAllArchiveSoftwarev2.5.ps1 (Current PowerShell Version):
This version performs quiet installations of .msi files, generating log files for each application in the archive folder. .exe files are installed with their normal graphical user interfaces.

Prerequisites (PowerShell Scripts)
PowerShell scripts are disabled by default. To enable for the current terminal session only:

powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass

Offline Install Steps

üìÇ updatingSoftware
This collection of PowerShell scripts is designed to automate the download, silent installation, and cleanup of .msi application installers. These scripts include pre-flight checks to prevent disruption during updates by ensuring critical applications are not running.

Scripts Included
Update-Egnyte-v1.0.ps1

Description: Basic download, silent install, and cleanup for Egnyte (or similar) .msi files. No pre-flight checks.

Update-Egnyte-v1.5.ps1

Description: Updated Egnyte installer with a crucial pre-flight check. It aborts if specified critical applications (e.g., Word, Excel, AutoCAD, Vectorworks) are running to prevent data loss or disruption.

Update-MSI-Application-Base-v1.5.ps1

Description: A generic template based on v1.5, providing a foundational structure for updating any .msi application with pre-flight checks. Requires customization of $downloadUrl, $fileName, and $criticalProcesses.

Features
Automated Download: Fetches .msi installers from specified URLs.

Silent Installation: Installs applications without user intervention (/quiet /norestart).

Cleanup: Removes the downloaded installer file post-installation.

Pre-flight Application Check (v1.5+): Prevents installation if specified critical applications are running.

Configurable: Easy modification of variables like download URL, local paths, and critical process names.

Prerequisites & Configuration
Windows Operating System, PowerShell (v5.1+).

Administrator privileges for installation.

Configuration: Open the desired script and modify $downloadUrl, $localDirectory, $fileName, and $criticalProcesses (for v1.5+ scripts).

Usage
Run the desired script from a PowerShell console. You may need to run PowerShell as an Administrator.

.\Update-Egnyte-v1.5.ps1
# or for the base template
.\Update-MSI-Application-Base-v1.5.ps1

If scripts are disabled, temporarily adjust the execution policy: Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force.
